# Python Project – AI/ML Modules for Sports Talent Assessment

## Overview
This Python project contains AI/ML modules used for analyzing athlete performance. It works with the main Flutter app to perform pose estimation, motion analysis, and other computations for sports talent assessment.

**Folder:** `python_project/`  
**Files included:**  
- `main.py` – Main script to run the analysis  
- `helper.py` – Helper functions for processing  
- `utils.py` – Utility functions (e.g., data handling, calculations)

---

## Features
- Pose detection using **MediaPipe**  
- Motion analysis with **OpenCV**  
- Numerical computations using **NumPy**  
- Can be extended to integrate with AI models for cheat detection or performance evaluation

## Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- Required Python packages (install via `requirements.txt`):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run
1.Navigate to the Python project folder:
